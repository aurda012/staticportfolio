Back-end frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Node allow for a broad range of data customization, user interface, and dynamic content generation. Front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and React help the development stage be more efficient and more functional than ever before. It is an ongoing process, with new technologies to learn coming out every day.</dd>

                    <dd class="m-b-30">Once the design and development of the project is near completion, it is time to deploy the project. During this stage, I push projects live on a web server or a service like Heroku to get it on the web. The testing during this stage is much more hands on, being able to see any bugs that may come into play once online. Once all is considered and revisions have been implemented I can finally push out version 1.0.</dd>

                    <dd class="m-b-30">The best stage during the whole process is finishing what I like to think of as the final product. There's nothing like seeing my initially vague idea become reality. It makes the whole process worth it. I strive to deliver the best product I can, with thoughtful design, bug free development, and extensive iterations to cater to all sorts of users. </dd>
